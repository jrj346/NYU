1 Design Analysis:
1 List and explain the types of logic gates used in adder 16
and its sub-modules



2 You have been tasked to build a 64-bit adder/subtractor.
Could you use adder 16 as a sub-module to build a 64-bit
adder/subtractor? If yes, how? if not, why?
3 What is the maximum frequency (fmax) at which
slow adder will run reliably? Does it run at the same speed
in all temperatures (0C and 85C)? If not, why?
4 What is “out reg” and its purpose? Give detailed
description of this component.

 2 Functional Analysis:
1 How does adder 16 perform subtraction?
2 List, explain and write function specification for each
sub-module within adder 16.
3 What is the use of “Cout”, an output of adder 16, and
does it confirm to functional specification? If not, why? and how could you fix it?


Use fast adder project for the activities 3 & 4.
3 Timing Analysis:
1 By design, how many logic levels are there in adder16?
2 How fast (MHz) is the clock running in fast adder?
3 Does fast adder meet fmax requirements? If not, why?
4 Redesign:
1 Redesign fast adder, in paper, to meet timing requirement.
2 Implement your modification using Quartus II software and
test it in DE0-Nano. You should make sure that your new design meets timing requirement before downloading it to DE0-Nano.
